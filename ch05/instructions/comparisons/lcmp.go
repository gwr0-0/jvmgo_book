Operation

Format

Forms
	lcmp = 148 (0x94)
Operand Stack
	..., value1, value2 â†’
	..., result
Description
	Both value1 and value2 must be of type long. They are both popped from the operand stack, and a signed integer comparison is performed.
	If value1 is greater than value2, the int value 1 is pushed onto the operand stack.
	If value1 is equal to value2, the int value 0 is pushed onto the operand stack.
	If value1 is less than value2, the int value -1 is pushed onto the operand stack.
